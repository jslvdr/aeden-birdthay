        <p>
            My dear love,<br><br>
            It's difficult to put into words everything I feel for you. Since the day our eyes met, my life has changed. You have become my waking dream, my daily smile. You are the one with whom I want to spend every moment, every second, every precious moment of my life. My heart is filled with love for you, and nothing will ever equal it. <br><br> When I think of you, I see a world of tenderness, complicity, and beauty. All the moments we share, our joys and our sorrows... all of it makes me the happiest woman in the world. And more than anything, I am blessed to have found my soulmate in you.<br><br> But I have found so much more in you, like beauty, the joy of living in the simplicity of life's little moments. I have found a shoulder to lean on, a precious asset in my life without which I would not be complete. Indeed, when you are far from me, I am no longer whole. My life is a two-piece puzzle, and you're the largest part. I need you to live and feel happy. You're handsome, intelligent, strong, attentive, patient (it depends on the time :) ), funny, and sincere. You're so special to me. <br><br> I love you more than words can express. And I'm grateful every day for the gift life has given me of allowing our paths to cross.<br><br> Forever and ever, I'll be here, your heart by my side. ❤️

                <p>I will always remember our first meeting. We were two souls destined to meet, but we didn't know it yet. We took time to get to know each other, we played a lot together and we started to know each other. Since that meeting with you, I cherish you and I thank Genshin for existing. If for once the game is good, it's because it allowed me to talk to you and bring me to where we are today. Thank you for accepting my demand this day and thank you for accepting the person i am now since. I hope time doesn't fly by too quickly, because I want to enjoy you as much as possible.</p>

                <p>Together, we've been through a lot. We've broken up several times, we've had tons of problems and disagreements. But what I take away from all of this is that we're still here today and I don't intend to let go of you until death do us part. We'll never be the perfect couple, nor ideal humans either. We each have our flaws and our qualities, and I will never stop appreciating them as well as your presence and your warmth. I love you, I love the years we spend together, and all the moments we spent together will remain etched in my memory forever. Thank you for giving me the chances to live these moments by your side.</p>

                <p>To talk about you, I wanted to let you know how much I love the person you are. You are like a breath of fresh air to me, like the morning dew, heralding sunshine, warmth, and happiness with each passing day. You give meaning to my life, but also meaning to the existence of this world. Before you, I didn't understand the why and how of the universe, but now I tell myself that maybe we are all meant to have soulmates, and mine is you. With each of your birthdays, I see you grow and mature, which makes me want to continue growing by your side and know you a little more each day.Once again, I love you more than anything, thank you so much for being part of my life.</p>
